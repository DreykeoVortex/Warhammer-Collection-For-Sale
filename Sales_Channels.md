# Warhammer & Miniatures Sales Channels

Here is a curated list of the best online communities and platforms to find a buyer for your entire Warhammer collection. The key to a successful sale is reaching a targeted audience of serious collectors and gamers.

## **Tier 1: High-Traffic, Dedicated Communities (Start Here)**

These are your best bets for finding a single buyer for a large lot.

### **1. Reddit - r/miniswap**
*   **Link:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/miniswap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/miniswap/)
*   **Why it's great:** This is the largest and most active community online specifically for buying, selling, and trading miniatures. It has a well-established reputation system (`[H]` Have, `[W]` Want, `[Loc]` Location format) and is frequented by serious collectors who are comfortable with large transactions.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Create a single, detailed post with a clear title (e.g., `[H] Massive Warhammer Fantasy Collection (3000+ models) [W] $$$ [Loc] Bonney Lake, WA`).
    *   In the body of the post, write a compelling summary of the collection.
    *   **Provide the link to your `collection_gallery.html`** (hosted on Google Drive/Dropbox).
    *   Be prepared to answer questions in the comments. Posts with active OP engagement do better.

### **2. Facebook Groups**
*   **Why it's great:** Facebook has several massive, highly active groups dedicated to buying and selling Warhammer. The platform makes it easy to share photos and communicate with potential buyers.
*   **Key Groups to Join:**
    *   **Warhammer 40k, AoS, and Fantasy Buy, Sell, Trade (USA/CAN)** - Very large and active.
    *   **The Warhammer Trading Post** - Another huge, general-purpose trading hub.
    *   **Oldhammer / Middlehammer Trading Group** - Specifically for collectors of older, classic miniatures like yours. This is a prime target.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Join the groups and read their rules carefully before posting.
    *   Create a post with a few "hero shots" of your best-looking armies to grab attention.
    *   Write a clear description and provide the link to your full gallery for serious inquiries.

## **Tier 2: General Hobby Forums**

These forums have dedicated "Swap Shop" or "Marketplace" sections and are frequented by long-time, serious hobbyists.

### **1. DakkaDakka - Swap Shop**
*   **Link:** [https://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/forums/show/22.page](https://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/forums/show/22.page)
*   **Why it's great:** DakkaDakka is one of the oldest and most respected wargaming forums. Its members are deeply knowledgeable and often have the capital for large purchases.
*   **Strategy:** Similar to r/miniswap, create a detailed post in the Swap Shop forum with a clear title and a link to your gallery.

### **2. Warseer - Trading Forum**
*   **Link:** [https://www.warseer.com/forums/forum.php?s=f4e5a9c0d8f0b7c1a5b8e9d3a4c1e8e8&f=11](https://www.warseer.com/forums/forum.php?s=f4e5a9c0d8f0b7c1a5b8e9d3a4c1e8e8&f=11)
*   **Why it's great:** Another long-standing and respected forum with a dedicated trading section. It has a global user base.

## **Tier 3: Broader Marketplaces (Use With Caution)**

These sites have a larger audience but are less specialized. You may get more low-ball offers, but they are worth considering.

### **1. eBay**
*   **Why it's great:** Massive reach, strong seller/buyer protection.
*   **Strategy for a Single Lot:**
    *   Do **NOT** auction this. Create a "Buy It Now" listing with "Or Best Offer" enabled.
    *   Set a high "Buy It Now" price (e.g., $25,000 or $30,000) to anchor the negotiation.
    *   The listing description is key. Use a few great photos, write a detailed summary, and **link to your external `collection_gallery.html`** for the full overview (check eBay's current rules on linking externally).
    *   Clearly state your delivery/shipping terms. The "Local Pickup Only" option is very important here.

### **2. Bartertown**
*   **Link:** [http://www.bartertown.com/trading/](http://www.bartertown.com/trading/)
*   **Why it's great:** A very old-school but still active trading site. It is exclusively for wargaming miniatures and has a dedicated user base.
